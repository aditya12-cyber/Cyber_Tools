DDos
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. DoS attacks accomplish this by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash.

A common type of DoS attack that is prevalent on the web is called the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that relies on infected computers or devices from around the world in a coordinated effort to block access.


KEY TAKEAWAYS
1 . A denial-of-service (DoS) is a form of cyberattack that prevents a rightful user from accessing a computer system, platform, or website.
2 . In a DoS attack, rapid and continuous online requests are sent to a target server in order to overload the server’s bandwidth.
3 . Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks leverage a wide web of computers or devices infected with malware that launch a coordinated barrage of meaningless online requests, blocking legitimate access.

How Denial-of-Service Attacks Work
DoS attacks are on the rise because as businesses and consumers use more digital platforms in communicating and transacting with each other, these cyberattacks target digital intellectual property and infrastructures. Cyberattacks are typically launched to steal personally identifiable information (PII), causing considerable damages to the businesses’ financial pockets and reputations. Data breaches can target a specific company or a host of companies at the same time. A company with high-security protocols in place may be attacked through a member of its supply chain with inadequate security measures. When multiple companies have been selected for an attack, the perpetrators can use a DoS approach.


In a DoS attack, the cyberattackers typically use one internet connection and one device to send rapid and continuous requests to a target server to overload the server’s bandwidth. DoS attackers exploit a software vulnerability in the system and proceed to exhaust the RAM or CPU of the server. The damage in loss of service done by a DoS attack can be fixed in a short time by implementing a firewall with allow and deny rules. Since a DoS attack only has one IP address, the IP address can be easily fished out and denied further access using a firewall. However, there is a type of DoS attack that is not so easy to detect—a distributed denial of-service (DDoS) attack.
